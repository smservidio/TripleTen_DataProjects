Triple Ten - Data Projects 

The following table provides a description of the projects I completed on while attending the Business Intelligence Analytics TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | Data Analysis: Manhattan Rental Market | The project task was to analyze user data and determine which neighborhoods were most desirable in terms of occupancy rate, as well as how much revenue these most desirable listings generated. |
| 2 | Comparative Analysis of Rideshare Trends Using SQL | The objective of this project was to analyze rideshare data from a competitor prior to Zuber's launch in a new market. Data was extracted to account for correlation in user preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. Please note that this project is not available on GitHub, as the project was done within an SQL module in the curriculum where no final document was generated.|
| 3 | Business Analytics: Analysis of User Activity for e-Commerce Retailer  | The project task was to transform raw user activity logs into actionable business insights by building a conversion funnel and conducting a cohort-based retention analysis. This included preparing and filtering data, creating pivot tables, calculating metrics like conversion rates and cohort retention, and organizing everything into a polished, executive-ready spreadsheet.  |
| 4 | Data Visualization with Tableau: Superstore | In this Data Visualization project, I acted as a consultant to help a struggling superstore improve profitability by analyzing profit and loss trends, evaluating advertising opportunities, and examining product return patterns. I created targeted visualizations to identify key profit drivers, recommended high-return advertising strategies based on return on ad spend, and assessed return rates to inform decisions on product lines and customer management. |
| 5 | Storytelling with Data: Superstore | This project involved identifying the root causes of high return rates at the Superstore by analyzing data across product categories, customer segments, geographic regions, and time periods. It culminated in the design and presentation of an interactive Tableau dashboard that highlighted key insights and recommended strategies to reduce returns. |
